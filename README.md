# Predictive Analytics for Financial Crime Detection: A Data-Driven Approach

## Project Overview
This project applies predictive analytics techniques to analyse financial transaction data for detecting money laundering risks. The study focuses on identifying transaction patterns, classifying risk levels, and analysing relationships between transaction amounts and shell company involvement to support Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts.

## Dataset Description
The analysis is based on a Black Money Transaction dataset containing 4,509 observations and key variables, including transaction amount (USD), money laundering risk score, number of shell companies involved, and number of persons involved.

## Methods and Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classification
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

## Key Analysis Focus
- Identification of transaction patterns based on money laundering risk score
- Classification of transactions into low and high-risk categories
- Relationship analysis between transaction amount and shell company involvement

## Results Summary
- Clustering methods identified distinct transaction groups, with high-risk clusters showing higher transaction amounts and greater shell company involvement. 
- Classification models demonstrated limited predictive performance, highlighting the need for further feature engineering. 
- Regression analysis revealed a weak relationship between transaction amounts and shell companies involved.
